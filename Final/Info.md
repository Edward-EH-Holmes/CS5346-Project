# 第一组图（文件夹1里）

## 信息
横轴代表时间（年-月）。左边纵轴代表“Children”数量，对应条形图。右边纵轴代表“Required Car Parking Spaces”的数量，对应折线图。

The horizontal axis represents time (year-month). The vertical axis on the left represents the number of "Children", corresponding to the bar chart. The vertical axis on the right represents the number of “Required Car Parking Spaces”, corresponding to the line chart.

## 结论
“Children”数量和“Required Car Parking Spaces”的数量有强关联性，相关线性系数（PPMCC）为0.644，线性方程为 y = 0.125x + 227.4506

There is a a strong correlation between the number of "Children" and the number of "Required Car Parking Spaces", the PPMCC is 0.644, and the linear equation is y = 0.125x + 227.4506

# 第二组图（文件夹2里）

## 信息
在第一组图的基础上加入了“hotel”的筛选器。勾选不同的筛选内容就可以获得不同的表。

Based on the first set of chart, a "hotel" filter was added. Different tables can be obtained by checking different filter contents.

## 结论
在城市酒店，“Children”数量和“Required Car Parking Spaces”的数量有强关联性，PPMCC为0.739，线性方程为 y = 0.1736x + 25.9557

在度假酒店，“Children”数量和“Required Car Parking Spaces”的数量有弱关联性，PPMCC为0.275

In city hotels, there is a strong correlation between the number of "Children" and the number of "Required Car Parking Spaces", the PPMCC is 0.739, and the linear equation is y = 0.1736x + 25.9557

In resort hotels, there is a weak correlation between the number of "Children" and the number of "Required Car Parking Spaces", with a PPMCC of 0.275

# 第三组图（文件夹3里）

## 信息
横轴代表时间（年-月）。纵轴代表“Children”数量。Tableau中的“Page”功能被使用，因此滑动滑块可以查看不同种类的餐食中儿童——时间的关系图。

The horizontal axis represents time (year-month). The vertical axis represents the number of "Children". The “Page” feature in Tableau was used so that the slider could be used to view graphs of children versus time for different types of meals.

## 结论
Most children staying in hotels like breakfast-only package service

Most of the other children choose the package service that provides breakfast, lunch, and dinner

# 第四组图（文件夹4里）

## 信息
在第三组图的基础上加入了“hotel”的筛选器。勾选不同的筛选内容就可以获得不同的表。

Based on the third set of chart, a "hotel" filter was added. Different tables can be obtained by checking different filter contents.

## 结论
Relative to resort hotels, the children-meal relationship graph shows stronger cyclical volatility for city hotels

Whether they are city hotels or resort hotels, the peak number of meals all occurs in July and August

In addition to the peak data, there is also a small peak in the city hotel meal data in April

# 3和4总结论（决策）
City hotels can increase the amount of food purchased in July and August every year, and can slightly increase the amount of food purchased in April every year, as appropriate.

The resort hotel can slightly increase the amount of food purchased in July and August every year.

For hotel meal preparation, whether it is a resort hotel or a city hotel, it is best to invest most of the ingredients in breakfast preparation

For resort hotels, consider reserving more ingredients for lunch and dinner
